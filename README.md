## About the Class Codewar
These challenges are optional daily challenge exercises designed for students in the Northwestern University Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.  Our goal is to complete 100 challenges before the end of Bootcamp.

## About CodeWars
[Codewars](www.codewars.com) is a community of developers, who are called Code Warriors (or just warriors), that train on improving their development skills. Think of it like a coding dojo - where developers train with each other and help each other get better through practice.

## Repo Organization
Challenges are divided into directories containing 10 challenges for convenience.  Each challenge is numbered sequentially.  The challanege JavaScript file will contain the challenge, a link to the challenge, and my solution.

I have also included tests using [jest](https://jestjs.io/), a JavaScript testing framework.  You must have [node.js](nodejs.org) installed as well as the jest node package, which you can install globally by running `npm install jest --global`.  For more detailed instructions, go to the [jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started).

## Running tests
To run the tests from a command line, run: `npm run test`
